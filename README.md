Symbolic AI vs NN for Fraud Detection using Paysim

The prevalence of digital technologies, the turn towards digital markets, and the abandonment of cash during Covid-19 have reignited the discussion of Anti-Money 
Laundering and Terrorism Financing frameworks used by financial institutions (Jocevski et al., 2020; Verkijika, 2020). After 9/11 financial institutions are bestowed 
to protect the state against terrorism financing. In that context, they are monitoring all transactions to ensure their legitimacy. At first, those processes were 
handled by humans as the technology required to automate was not available. However, the increase in the volume, velocity, and variety of transactions forced the 
sector to invest in technology solutions, therefore, financial institutions started incorporating Artificial Intelligence in Fraud Detection 
(Sustainable and resilient finance, 2020). 
Almost 80 years have passed since the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and this research domain is still considered cutting-edge. The first 40 years of AI were 
all about symbols, decision trees, and statistical models, even if Rosenblatt established Neural Networks in 1958. The AI winter as it was characterized came to an 
end in the early 90s when a Frenchman called Yann LeCun re-established the idea of Neural Networks. From that point onwards, the AI community splits into two camps, 
the loyalist to Old Fashioned AI and the forward-looking scientists of Neural Networks (Olazaran, 1996). Even if symbolic AI is considered obsolete, it is still 
believed that it could outperform NNs in tabular data (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022). 
Therefore, in this code I examine these two approaches in a real-life complexity like Fraud Detection and to answer which of the two approaches is more 
appropriate for tabular data. Before experimenting, the dataset will be analyzed to understand its characteristics and the kind of preparation needed before 
feeding it to Random Forest and the Multi-Layer Perceptron. Finally, the experiments will be conducted using a cloud-based IDLE called Google Colab as computational 
power is needed for the creation of the models
